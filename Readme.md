<h3>Image Processing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    Capture two images, that will be used for processing, (one underexposed, and one
overexposed)
        <ol>Apply the gamma transformation to these two gray level images to correct their
appearance.
        </ol>
        <ol>Test several parameters of gamma until obtaining the best results and plot the
histograms of both original and corrected images.
        </ol>
    </li>
    OpenCV, numpy, and Matplot to load, process, and visualize the information.
        <h3>Result: </h3>
